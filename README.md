This repository contains work samples to demonstrate the Python capabilities of Ye Eun Lee. This code was inititally written for CMPSC 101, an introductory computer science course at the Pennsylvania State University.

Files "Homework 1 - 4" demonstrate a basic understanding of core Python functions. At this time, the original objectives/instructions for each assignment cannot be obtained.

The file "Final Project" is accompanied by two text files, "Capitals" and "CapitalsShort". This project served as the final demonstrative exhibition of all skills learned throughout the course.
